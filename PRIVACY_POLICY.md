codefoss - Privacy Policy
</h2>

**codefoss aims to protect the privacy of its users. Our Privacy Policy gives detailed information on which data the app stores in order to work, how it is being used, and how the project protects your personal information. It is recommended to read the privacy policy of codefoss as well as the privacy policy of the instance you have chosen inside the platform.**

### Information Collection
codefoss only stores necessary data such as watch history, settings, and bookmarks. Users have the option to refrain from utilizing data storage features. The platform does not gather any information regarding its usage, nor does it create user profiles or track user activity. Additionally, the application avoids implementing tracking mechanisms within third-party libraries that it utilizes.

### Information Use
codefoss doesn't share your data with third parties. When using the app without logging in to a codefoss account, no data will be shared with any codefoss servers. Instead, the data will be stored solely on the device. However, once a user logs in to a codefoss account, their subscriptions and playlists will be saved to that account on the corresponding codefoss instance.

### Instances & Data handling
In case the user is not logged in to a codefoss account on any instance, user data remains private and is not shared with any third parties. Local playlists are stored on the app and not shared with codnap. Users have the option to disable the feature that records their browsing history and timestamps. This information is stored only locally and is not shared with any other codefoss instances.

### codefoss account
codefoss accounts can be completely deleted with no history kept, providing increased security for users on the site.

### Data Security
codefoss connects to codefoss instances instead of directly to official platform like meta , snapchat, twitter etc, providing an additional layer of privacy. However, trust is shifted to the instance owner. codefoss instances do not log user-specific data, but there is no guarantee regarding the actions of the instance owner. In the event that logging occurs on codefoss, the amount of data collected would be lower than what is typically gathered by the official platform like meta ,snapchat, twitter, etc. This is because codefoss does not send user behavior or other telemetry data to the server of the instance being used.

### Open Source Software
codefoss is an **open source software** that is built for learning and research purposes. We welcome and encourage collaboration and contributions from the community to help improve the platform.

### Changes to Privacy Policy
By using the codefoss platform, you consent to the handling of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, you are free to open an issue to ask about it or ask at the official [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#codefoss:matrix.org) of the platform.
