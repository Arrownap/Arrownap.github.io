The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many established fields (including educational psychology, neuropsychology, experimental psychology, cognitive sciences, and pedagogy), as well as emerging fields of knowledge (e.g. with a shared interest in the topic of learning from safety events such as incidents/accidents, or in collaborative learning health systems). Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of habituation, or classical conditioning, operant conditioning or as a result of more complex activities such as play, seen only in relatively intelligent animals. Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided or escaped may result in a condition called learned helplessness. There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally, in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation, indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development."}),(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:"Play has been approached by several theorists as a form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play.

For Vygotsky, however, play is the first form of learning language and communication, and the stage where a child begins to understand rules and symbols. This has led to a view that learning in organisms is always related to semiosis, and often associated with representational systems/activity."})]})]})]}),(0,a.jsx)(r.Z,{}),(0,a.jsx)(o.Z,{})]})}i(7788),i(1664)}},function(e){e.O(0,[799,996,549,839,661,788,373,774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=4830)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
