About
</h2>

Nowdays, platforms has an extremely invasive [privacy policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10364219) which relies on using user data in unethical ways. They store a lot of your personal data - ranging from ideas, music taste, content, political opinions, and much more than you think.

This project is aimed at improving the users' privacy by being independent from Big tech companies and bypassing their data collection.


The [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#fosstube:matrix.org) is considered as the main communication channel, all other forums or social media accounts are maintained by volunteers from the community but not the developer(s).
